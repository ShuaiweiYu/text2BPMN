The quince harvesting process takes place in October and November. Every day, from 7am the manager checks that the plantation has not been
affected by codling moth. If it is affected that day's production is interrupted. The employees begin to pick the fruits at 8am,
when the quinces have almost no dew. If the workers have not taken a break before 1pm, the manager reminds them that they should take a break soon.
7 hours after the employees started picking the fruits, the trucks come and the employees load them at most until 5pm.
The supervisor notes down the spoiled fruit not later than 30 minutes after the trucks have been loaded.
In the evening, the supervisor reports the total number of kilos collected and the hours the employees have worked.
