The order-to-cash process is carried out by a sellerâ€™s organization which includes two departments: the sales department and the warehouse & distribution department. The purchase order received by warehouse & distribution is checked against the stock. This operation is carried out automatically by the ERP system of warehouse & distribution, which queries the warehouse database. If the product is in stock, it is retrieved from the warehouse before the sales department confirms the order.  Next, the sales department emits an invoice and waits for the payment, while the product is shipped from within warehouse & distribution. The process completes with the order archival in the sales department. If the product is not in stock, the ERP system within warehouse & distribution checks the raw materials availability by accessing the suppliers catalog. Once the raw materials have been obtained the warehouse & distribution department takes care of manufacturing the product. The process completes with the purchase order being confirmed and archived by the sales department.
