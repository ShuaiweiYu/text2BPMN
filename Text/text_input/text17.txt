Whenever Elite Holdings receives a customer request, it demands a solvency check from Miracle Credit.
At Miracle Credit exactly two clerks perform a solvency check.
Miracle Credit hands back the results of the solvency check to Elite Holding.
If the solvency check is not passed, a clerk from the customer advisory informs the customer and deletes the customer's request.
If the solvency check is passed, Anna or Hans, bot not both, develop a payment schedule.
Afterward, the schedule is sent to the manager.
Both he and another clerk with the role supervisor must approve the payment schedule.
Approve payment schedule may never be executed by Anna or Hans.
If the payment schedule has been approved, an email is sent to the customer automatically, otherwise, the customer advisory calls the customer to suggest an alternative.
In both cases, the request must be closed.
